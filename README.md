# UnwrellaConnect Extension for Blender

**UnwrellaConnect for Blender** is a free extension that enables the use of Unwrella-IO or Packer-IO directly from within Blender.

All functionality is directly available from within Blender's UV editor and all interaction between the programs happens transparently in the background. Unwrap anything without any manual exporting and re-importing of objects.

## Requirements
